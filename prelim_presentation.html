              <ol>
                <li >  (1) emotion,  <b><hl>[HIT NEXT]</b></hl>

          <li >  In those 4 years, I became very well-versed in 3 Cog Sci topics in particular :
            <ol>
              <li > emotion,  <b> &nbsp;NEXT STEP ⇒ &nbsp;</b>
              <li>learning, <b>&nbsp;NEXT STEP ⇒&nbsp;</b>

          <li > I ended up finding the field of Geospatial Analytics from which I became a Geospatial Scientist,
          <li >  As a Geospatial Scientist, I saw extremely exciting opportunities to continue researching these Cognitive Science topics of emotion learning and HCI,, but approach them <b>from a Geospatial Science Perspective instead</b>
          <li > The resulting research is what has formed my dissertation I am proposing today
          <li > In this dissertation, I
            <ol> 
              <li > <b>&nbsp;NEXT STEP ⇒&nbsp;</b>combine my experience with emotion research with geo-statistics and -modeling techniques to explore interactions between the environment and human emotions / behavior ( this formed my CH 1); 
              <li > <b>&nbsp;NEXT STEP ⇒&nbsp;</b>I then leverage my background in learning research with theories of embodied cognition to facilitate more natural ways to learn about landscapes (which makes up CH 2); 
              <li > <b>&nbsp;NEXT STEP ⇒&nbsp;</b>and for my last Chapter, Chapter 3,  I propose using HCI principles to evaluate and improve geospatial technologies for better decision-making (CH 3)

Those studies were there but not really people moving this fast and looking at the viewshed which took into account the full 3D information from lidar, not just looking at land-use, but actually all 3d data so that we could even see that their real views were actually quite limited due to vegetation  </b>

                    So to assess 3D spatial learning using TUIs, we used the following evaluation methods: 
                    <ol> 
                      <li> the Topographic Map Assessment, 
                      <li> 2 Tangible Lesson Assessments, 
                      <li> and a User Experience Survey. 
                    </ol>
                    <br><br>
  
                    <li> And I will describe each in detail....
                    <br><br>
  
                    <li> So, we administered the Topographical Map Assessment (developed by Newcombe & colleagues) to measure students' overall acquisition & transfer of spatial skills, given to participants in the 1st session & 2 weeks after the last session
                    <ul>
                      <li> And what I mean by "Spatial Skills" here is that students are able to understand how elevation is encoded on topographic maps & how 3D terrain shape is represented on maps)
                    </ul>
                    <li> 2 Tangible Lesson assessments were also adminstered before and after each tangible lesson (minus Water Flow; TMA had hydrology questions..), which measured student’s spatial knowledge specific to the content being taught in each tangible lesson.
                      <ul>
                        <li> So, the landforms assessment tested them on geomorphology concepts introduced to them with Tangible Landscape, and the cut & fill assessment was structured the same way, just for eath moving / grading concepts instead.
                      </ul>
                    <!-- <li> Overall, the TMA contains 3 types of topographic map test items:
                        <ol> 
                            <li> elevation items–require an understanding of how elevation is represented through contour lines;
                            <li> shape items–comprehension of 3D shapes within the represented terrain; 
                            <li> shape and elevation items–contain both the aforementioned constructs.
                          </ol> -->

                <li>And so to do this I'm proposing a HCI experiment that will specifically investigate the information acquisition patterns of decision making groups as they try to solve specific disease management problems together.
                <li>And while they do that, I'm proposing to collect user metrics similar to what was shown in TL study (UX survey, etc) to investigate and standardize constructs of system suitability for web collaboration contexts in the specific problem space of managing plant disease spread virtually.

                <li>Ultimately, this  work  intends  to  establish  the  first  steps  toward  an empirically  supported,  user-guided  general  framework for online SDSS design, functionality, and use for collaborative ecological decision-making -->

          <li>In the proposed research, users must collaboratively use PoPS which is the Pest or Pathogen Spread Web Platform, an interactive online geospatial user interface system (also can be known as an SDSS), to effectively reduce predicted pest and pathogenspread while minimizing treatment costs during a management scenario<br><br>
          <!-- <li>To predict the spread of their species of interest, users provide PoPS with a host raster and the locations and timing of species detections, as well as information about the species’ biology. The model then predicts when and where a species is likely to establish, based on where it is already found, its dispersal capability, the locations of suitable hosts, and the impact of precipitation and temperature on its survival and reproduction. Model outputs include predicted infested or infected area, number of infested or infected hosts, the probability of the pest or pathogen escaping quarantine and spread in the cardinal directions. -->

          <li>PoPS is uniquely suited for examining the potential impact of management strategies on spread, allowing users to compare a forecast without management to forecasts based on “what-if” scenarios that treat or remove hosts. (SIMILAR TO TL'S EXPLORATION])
          <!-- <li> PoPS (Fig.  2.2) is an online interface that allows users to  design  management  scenarios  by  drawing  treatment polygons  on  a  web  map  of  the  study  area.

          <li> so i'll conduct statistical analyses to investigate overall constructs of the participants ability to solve these problems 

          <li> because this research actually predicts that in the collaborative  setting  participants will engage in more effective decision making because they are allowed to discuss with their team members about what the best possible solution would be and kind of help each other resolve any uncertainty in the proposed solutions 
          
          <li> so to carry this analyses out i'll just run a really simple t-test comparing the differences between the collaboration group and the individual group on their overall performance on the disease management scenarios and tasks 
          
          <li> then for usability and user experience the only thing that i'm really able to predict with this is to say that usability and user experience will be rated higher given higher performance on these disease management scenarios 
          
          <li> my predictions for this are limited because there really isn't a lot of literature out on if people perceive a system better or a like a system more if they're allowed to work with others on it 
          
          <li> and this is what i'm really actually very interested in seeing in the results; seeing how their ratings of the system's usability and effectiveness to manage the spread of plant disease changes between working with others or working alone.

          <li > I also wanted to briefly go over some of my work that won't necessarily lead to any dissertation chapters, but was the very first project I was on as a student here at the center: <b>GAPS - Geospatial Applications for Problem Solving</b>
          <li > And is another way I've explored how we can learn about the world. This time more focused on how high school students can learn about it, and more importantly be excited about doing so!!
          <li > So, GAPS is a free Saturday program for high school students interested in using the latest cutting-edge technologies in the geospatial sciences to solve real-world problems, and in learning about all the exciting benefits of a career in the geospatial sciences. 
          <li > And my main responsibilities included: 
            <ol>
              <li> developing and running activities with Tangible Landscape and other related curricula lessons to increase underrepresented high school students' spatial thinking and interest in GIS (STEM) and... 
              <li> Lead the evaluative efforts on the program as a whole, basically to see whether or not the program was an effective way to get students excited about geospatial science and science in general
                <li> I did this by focusing on the three overall goals you see on the slide, (which will revisit here in a moment):

                          <li > <u>Water Flow</u>: Students are asked to assume the role of a landscape contractor as they try to find appropriate villa construction sites across a mountainous territory. 
                          <li > <u>Trail Planning</u>: Students are assigned to plan a low-intensity hiking route in the Smoky Mountains meant for seniors and children. 
                          <li > <u>Landforms</u>: Students use given sand to create the required landforms and label them with the colored markers.
                          <li > <u>Channeling</u>: Students are tasked with reshaping the topography with the overall goal of diverting all the simulated water from the “construction site” to the “stormwater drain” located downhill.
                          <li > <u>Cut & Fill</u>: students must modify the given landscape using cut and fill projection (basic and advanced)
                          <li > <u>Ponding</u>: Students are given a limited amount of sand to build a damn on a stream to impound the maximum volume of water possible.

    The main constructs assessed with the survey were: <br>
    (1) <b>Performance Expectancy:</b> which refers to the degree a user thinks using a system will help them perform well on a task; <br>
    (2) <b>Pragmatic Quality:</b> Practicality of a system's use, in this case we refer to the physical objects (wooden carving tools, physical landscape model) and visual objects (projection, digital feedback) used during interaction.
    (3) <b>Effort Expectancy:</b> known as a system’s perceived ease of use
    (4) <b>User Experience:</b> focuses on overall satisfaction, comfort, and perceptions of the system’s effectiveness

  Across both methods there are the most notable contributions I made.


  I Developed a novel method for modeling the experience of urban landscapes.

  This method led to development of two software which can be potentially usefull for other researchers.

  -- The framework for realtime rendering and VR with geospsatial data is also Novel and has not been developed before as a software.
  Also, this is the first effort that tried to use realistic 3D rendering in conjuction with Tangible user interfaces.
