            <li> Hi everyone, and thank you for coming today. A special thank you to Dr. Peter James for inviting and organizing this talk.
            <li> My name is Garrett Millar, I'm a PhD student in Geospatial Analytics at North Carolina State University. Geospatial Analytics--the science of WHERE things HAPPEN. 
            <li> I'm here today to talk with you all about People & the Environment. Well, that could mean just about anything right? So more specifically, we'll be looking at ways to measure and also map how people interact with the environment. 
            <li> To do so, we'll go over different geo-analytical guidelines, techniques, and software tools, for empirically measuring people's environmental interaction and experience.
            <li> LETS GET STARTED!!

            <!-- Garrett Millar is a User Experience Researcher and Geospatial Scientist. In 2016, he earned his Bachelor's Degree in Psychology at North Carolina State University. Carrying extensive domain knowledge in the Cognitive Sciences, particularly the experience and knowhow for collecting biometric data, Garrett transitioned to the field of Geospatial Science in 2017. Where now, as a third year PhD student at North Carolina State's Center for Geospatial Analytics, he develops and evaluates geospatial applications and visualizations. A particular focus of his research is placed on using mobile sensing technologies like smart watches to improve our understanding of how people experience their environment. Lastly, he and his 6-month old German Shepherd puppy, Cassius, really enjoy the outdoors -->
            <!-- Mobile sensing technologies like smart watches are going mainstream. With improvements in quality, affordability, and ability, they provide a unique opportunity for spatial sciences. They particularly provide the opportunity to understand not only how people behave, but more importantly, how they experience their environment. By providing a human-centered approach for extracting contextual physiological information from mobile sensor data, geospatial analytics provides the capability to derive where, when, and in particular, how people’s behavior, experience, and health relate to their surrounding environment. Results are directly applicable in domains such as urban planning, environmental health, and epidemiology, wherein researchers can efficiently explore how human behavior varies as a function of location, space, and time. This talk will be delivered with an overall focus on People & the Environment. During which, various geo-analytical guidelines, techniques, and software tools, will be presented for empirically measuring people's environmental interaction and experience. -->

      <ul> 
          <li> In our daily comings and goings between home, work and school, the streets and bike paths we choose to navigate are also an emotional map of our commute. 
          <li> Where do we consistently experience frustration with traffic? 
          <li> Or anxiety from a tricky intersection?    
          <li> I believe questions such as these are becoming more and more important to ask 
          <li> Mainly because the ways we now get around town, or go to and from work and school, continue to become more diverse, and more popular: 
            <ul> 
                <li> skateboarding
                <li> mopeds
                <li> biking
                <li> walking
                <li> electric scooters
            </ul>
          <li> Questions such as places where we find ourselves consistently getting stressed, or always feel more at ease are the ones we'll be asking, exploring, and hopefully answering together today.
          <li> And if some of you are able to walk away with some answers to these questions, then I'll consider today's presentation a success :D

      <ul> 
          <li> So what I'll particular be talking about today is how mapping the locations of strong emotions can help improve the human experience
          <li> Specifically because it can help decision-makers (urban / city planners) identify where environments inspire either calm or stress.
          <li> But before we get into that, let's start from the very, very top, by asking some overarching questions: 
              <ul> 
                  <li> <b> why emotions? </b>
                  <li> <b> and why would we want to try and map them? </b>
              </ul>
          <li> Well, emotions play a major role in our day-to-day lives, as they play a large part in how we perceive and experience the world. 
          <li> People can experience a wide range of different emotions, but usually depend on the context, or the place, in which they are experienced.    
      </ul>

<!-- <h3>Emotions</h3> -->
<aside class="notes"> 
    <ul> 
        <!-- <li class="fragment fade-in">Why do emotions matter?</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in">Measuring emotion (skin conductance)</li>
        <li class="fragment fade-in">Mapping emotional experiences</li> -->
        <li> In fact, emotions are nothing more than a physiological response to some sort of stimuli, which tend to arise from our environment. 
        <li> Take for example whats being shown to you now. That is, a dog just trying to be friendly and say hello, but accidentally scares an unsuspecting cyclist passing by the dog's yard. I can promise the dog didn't mean to scare him, he's a good boy. 
        <li> The good boy, an external stimulus in the environment, barks, scares the cyclist (an initial physiological response), who is then stressed (emotion) following the encounter.
        <!-- <li> But, the cyclist still became scared, and continues to feel uneasy afterward. Not only that, but research shows that if the cyclist takes that route in the future, and remembers the dog, he will even become stressed before even passing by the yard. Just knowing a stressful event is going to occur will affect someone's stress levels. This is where the context of where people experience emotion gets foggy. If someone can be stressed before, during, AND after experienceing a stressor in the environment, how in the world can we identify the stress's true cause? -->
        <li>  So, we need to have a way to look at what people are feeling not just in general, but EXACTLY where they are feeling it, so we can not only understand how we interact with our environment, but also understand and optimize our emotional and physical well-being.
        <!-- <li> Traditional data, analytics, and visualizations fall short here. -->
        <li> But, this apparent physiological response to a stimulus, would need to be measured in order to do so. So how would we go about doing so?

              <li> Just knowing a stressful event is going to occur will affect someone's stress levels before experiencing the event (anticipatory stress). This is where the context of where people experience emotion starts to get a bit foggy. 
              <li> If someone can be stressed before, during, <b>AND</b> after experiencing a stressor in the environment, how in the world can we identify and locate the stress's true source? 
              <li> This is where traditional data, analytics, and visualizations fall short. They just can't match this needed level of spatial specificity and contextual clarity.
              <li> To sum this all up, human emotion is a very complex phenomenon and extremely hard to pin down and measure. Spatial data provide a quantitative way of understanding the deeply important context of emotions, and the environmental stimuli that spark them.
              <li> However, these methods and resulting data are of course still far from perfect, so we need to consider and address certain methodological limitations when conducting research such as this.

            <li>Wearables allow for continuous measurement at a high temporal resolution of parts of seconds. This resolution cannot be obtained when relying on one-time measurements or self-report surveys alone.
               
            <li> Wearables significantly reduce the burden on participants, who are not required to repeatedly complete surveys. This makes an extended data collection period—ranging from a few hours to several months—possible.

            <li> Finally, ambulatory measurements facilitate the investigation of people’s physiological signals during their daily routines in real-life situations, offering greater ecological validity than lab studies

            <!-- <li>  And it aims to develop and promote cycle highways as an effective and cost efficient low carbon solution for commuting towards and from work (in urban areas specifically).  -->
            <li> And this project particularly involves infrastructure adaptation to increasing e-bike use. 
            <li> Basically, existing cycling infrastructure is not up to the standards required by heavy e-bike use. 
            <li> Just think how much faster an e-cyclist is in comparison to your standard manual bike. 
            <li> Signs (directions) are too small, cycle paths cant properly account for the presence of both regular and e-bike use (e-bikes passing by fast)
            <li> And so to begin exploring how these cycle highways might be adapted to account for increasing e-bike use, researchers at Breda University of Applied Sciences ran a small study to collect some data along a cycling track between Tilburg and Waalwijk ... <b>NEXT SLIDE</b>

            <li>  So while human emotion is a very complex phenomenon, and extremely hard to pin down, there are physiological indicators that our bodies exhibit which can be used to infer whether or not someone is feeling an emotion in the first place. To break it down step by step:
              <ol>
                  <li>  Brain senses emotion
                  <li>  Nervous system triggers sweat glands on hands and feet

                  <li>  More current gets passed between two electrodes (conductivity)
              </ol>

              <li>  Then, technology like the Empatica E4, a wrist worn wearable specifically designed to measure skin conductance, uses two active electrodes on the bottom of the wrist to measure changes in people’s skin conductivity (or electric currents).

                <li>  But... here in this study, we have 12 people riding a bicycle, and we have terabytes of data. 
                <li> Should this be considered as another kind of geospatial big data?? 
                <li> Its a very different type of data because its geospatial, but you are also getting this street imagery, which, is very different from landsat
                <li>In any case, the data is availabe and there is a lot of potential to do more work on it.

        Due to these issues,  <br><br>

        I made an app which can be used to look at where people are feeling things, and really zoom in on it, so that a manager can go, "Ok, a person felt something here, whats there??"  <br><br>
  
        But, researchers can also use it to discover interesting patterns when exploring newly collected data, to then better direct where they should focus their research efforts.  <br><br>
  
        So, just to quickly demonstrate . . . .  <br><br>
  
          On the left, we can toggle back and forth between these different cyclists, which is an important thing to note due to the variability in skin conductance that can be exhibited across multiple people.  <br><br>
  
          So, starting with Cyclist # 1, and looking at the colored markers displayed on the map (blue = low arousal, red = high arousal), we can see that they were experiencing some high levels of arousal in this area.  <br><br>
  
          We can also coordinate what we're seeing on the map, with the skin conductance chart in the top-right corner.  <br><br>
  
          [HOVER MOUSE OVER CHART TO DISPLAY NUMERICAL DATA] <br><br>
  
          This chart will graphically display all data that is currently loaded into the map frame. As I zoom in and out, and pan around in the map, it will automatically update (as you can see here). v<br>
  
          Now lets throw a couple more cyclists into the mix to see if others are experiencing similar states of arousal, or if Cyclist 1 is just an overall anxious person. <br><br>
  
          [CLICK CYCLIST 3] <br><br>
  
          So here, it appears these two are experiencing similar levels of high physiological arousal. Lets zoom out a bit and add another cyclist to get a better idea of the bigger picture. <br><br>
  
          [ZOOM OUT] <br><br>
  
          [CLICK CYCLIST 10] <br><br>
  
          So this area [MOVE OVER WITH MOUSE], seems to be causing some heightened states of physiological arousal. Seeing this, we of course would like to explore what is present in the environment that might be causing such reactions. To do so, I can first click one one of the markers ...  <br><br>
  
          [CLICK POINT RIGHT BEFORE WATER] ...  <br><br>
  
          to view additional information such as the speed the cyclist was going at that specific point, as well as the current elevation (NL is extremely flat), the total distance travelled to that point, specific skin conductance levels, and which cyclist it is. <br><br>
  
          But, as you may have noticed, a street view image is also concurrently and automatically displayed in the bottom right corner. With this, it is easier to understand what sort of environment the cyclist is interacting with and experiencing while exhibiting high (or low) levels of emotion. <br><br>
  
          [ZOOM TO SELECTED POINT] --> [ROTATE MAP VIEW, TILT, etc]  <br><br>
  
          While the application is interesting visually, and is a good way to kill time (and I'm definitely not speaking from personal experience or anything), its main purpose is a research tool, designed to help researchers (THIS IS YOU ALL) better direct what they should focus their research efforts on.  <br><br>
  
          With the way the system's structure is designed, most spatiotemporal data, especially emotion data, can be easily inputted and explored. For example, the analyses just discussed, as well as the visualizations and interactive application presented, can be applied to other interesting, but similar domains such as mapping emotional data collected inside and outside museums.  <br><br>

          <li>  Basically, what I hoped to be able to show you all today is how linking location and physiological data helps us contextualize and understand how people respond to their surrounding environment . . . 
          <li>  Because we, as people, don’t exist without our environment. Understanding that environment is therefore key to understanding, and optimizing, our emotional and physical well-being.
